Hey there, fellow code wizard, Welcome to my [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) config repo! This baby has been tuned to deliver a turbocharged editing experience that'll have you kicking butt and taking names in no time. I've optimized this setup to be easy on your system resources and lightning-fast to load, thanks to the magic of lazy loading with the awesome. [ðŸ’¤Lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) plugin. And of course, what's a modern nvim setup without some Language Server Protocol (LSP) action? My config has got you covered, with a super smooth and lazy loaded LSP setup that'll have you coding like a boss in no time. So come on in, strap yourself in, and let's take this baby for a spin!
